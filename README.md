I spent a ton of time on this and never really used it. I included a documentation file that should have most/all featers listed. I "vide coded" this so security and whatnot might be a problem. If you have any questions or want to contribute back just do the thing and if I see it Id be happy to help/deal with it.

Its been a while since I made this so I dont remember a lot of it, I included the doccumentation I have so maybe that will help. I looked for a bot like this and couldnt find one, this one is pretty cool if you have a group that will use it. I had to rewrite a lot of it many times to get the crafting system to work how I wanted it to. This was made for a ttrpg server I was trying to get going but I couldnt find enough people that were interested. Best of luck to you and invite me if you get something off the ground and I would gladly help build some stuff:D
